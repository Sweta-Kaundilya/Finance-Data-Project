# Finance Data Project <br/>
**This project is just meant to practice visualization and pandas skills, it is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice.** <br/>
In this project we'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308) all the way to early 2016.<br/>
